Hey dudes, this is my first article in my new blog module using Kraken.js, Paypal's nodeJS framework.

I remind you that this module, if you like it, could be found on github at: https://github.com/RoCat/resumejs !

I'm not as familiar as I want with blogging and markdown language which is used to write this post so please be indulgent.. more of that, you can make suggestions using the "contact" menu at the top of this page.

I'll try to write some others, dealing with experiences I had with nodejs language, and other backend stuff !
